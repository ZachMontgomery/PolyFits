# Introduction

This package allows multivariable polynomial fits using Least Squares Regression with full control over the polynomial terms and custom weighting of data points.

This module contains functions to calculate and use the polynomial coefficients for an arbitrary order polynomial curve fit to a dataset with an arbitrary number of independent variables.
